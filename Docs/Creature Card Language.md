Creature Card Language

This is for a creature combat card game inspired by Blue Prince. The idea is that you have cards with unknown power, and you have to learn more about the world to learn what your cards do and how to unlock their full potential. The card text is going to be written in another language. I’ll use English here just to help me get a sense of what im doing. But in the end itll be translated into a different language and potentially also different symbols.

On a player’s turn, they can only do 1 of three things:

-   Play a card
-   Move a card
-   Activate a card’s activatable ability

Turns are very quick.

The board has 3 files (or more). Each player can put 1 creature (or more) onto each file. Creatures in the same file fight each other at the end of the battle. Creatures closest to the enemy are in Rank 1 (frontline). Creatures furthest from the enemy are in Rank 8 (or more) (backline).

Creature stats include:

-   Power
-   RPS symbol (Rock-Paper-Scissors)
-   Cost to play

Creatures don’t really die in this game. You amass an army of them and then total their power. Player with the most power in a file wins that file. Player who wins the most files wins the game.

EX: a R4 creature has more power than a R3 creature, so the R4 creature wins.

A creature that beats an enemy creature with RPS symbols reduces that creature’s power. This means a creature that has lower power can still win through RPS.

EX: a R4 creature has more power than a P3 creature, but P beats R, so the P3 creature beats the R4 creature.

But overwhelming power can still win through the RPS.

EX: a R15 creature has more power than a P3 creature. Even though P beats R, the R15 creature beats the P3 creature.

Triggers:

-   WhenPlayed
-   WhenMoved
-   WhenAllyMoved
-   WhenEnemyMoved

Keywords:

-   Played
-   Moved
-   Ally
-   Enemy
-   Rank
-   File

An ability is made up of 3 things:

-   Trigger
-   Condition
-   Action

When the trigger happens, the condition is checked. If the condition is met, then the action happens.

Most of these triggers happen automatically, at least in the videogame version.

There are no passives. Passives have to be phrased as “when X happens, and Y is true, then Z happens” as described above.

There are no replacement effects. Triggers happen AFTER the event that triggered it. This keeps the abilities simple.

The main reason why we need to keep the abilities simple is so they can more easily be figured out by observation. The cards are going to be near unintelligible, especially at the start of the game when the player doesn’t know anything yet. Hopefully, the cards will be easy to read once the player knows what to look for, but until then, the effects need to be understandable. Visual communication is key. And so is simplicity.

# Creatures

Starter creatures:

-   Cardinal: P1
-   Turtle: R1
-   Rabbit: S1

These 3 give you the option to play RPS anytime. The early battles will be against 1 power creatures, so the RPS mechanic is essential here.

Another early encounter will be a single 3 power creature, to show that power also matters.

The 3 starters have no special abilities, and neither will the first few encounters. This is so the player can more easily pick up on the key info: RPS symbol and power.

# RPS Symbol

Hmmm… maybe the RPS symbol will also contain the power. It’ll be all one symbol, rolled into one.

The creature ability symbol has the three sections as mentioned above. The trigger is the outer most layer. The condition is the middle layer. The action is the core. Each ability symbol has 1 action core. An action core can consist of several actions.

There are multiple pathways to the core. Each trigger has an associated condition. If the trigger happens and its condition is true, it does the effect, ignoring the other trigger/condition pairs.

Some ability symbols might not have every piece. If they don’t have a trigger, it defaults to when this creature is played. If it doesn’t have a condition, it defaults to true. If it doesn’t have an effect, it does nothing. Abilities might also have a cost, which is part of the condition. The default condition of true also has a default cost associated with it, depending on the creature.

Some creatures have abilities by default. You can also add/change abilities on creatures you have.

# Plot

So if I get an artist or someone else, im probably going to let them have authority over this. But in the meantime, I would like to connect this game to one of my existing worlds. And that world, I decided, would be Agranari.

It’s already been established (in some thought stream doc somewhere, probably) that the Anthro animals were made by an alien device that landed and mutated existing animals to have human DNA. Additionally, another alien tech landed on the same planet, but these were nanobots that could control feral animals.

When you start the game, all you know is that you control the animals. You don’t know any story or anything. But then you find these Anthro versions of the animals, that fight back and cant be captured by your nanobots (which you don’t know about yet).

Then you realize that the Anthro animals are the “good guys” and the nanobots are the “bad guys”. Im not sure how yet, especially with the visuals of the tech being a bit “good”-looking. Or what that even means.

And then, you find out later that the character you control is actually one of these Anthro animals, who is wearing a headset that lets them control these nanobots. And what are they doing with it? Im not sure.

But this has some interesting lore implications, for sure.

So the game “ends” when either you defeat the alien tech making the Anthro animals, or the nano bots get wiped out, or you find a way to lock the Anthro bot and the nanobots into a purgatory where neither can win.

So in the actual lore, these two alien techs come from the same planet (Earth), but they’re rivals. They both are machines sent on behalf of their creators. They both want to take over the planet using the native animals of that planet, but go about it using different means. Both of their end goals are to wipe out the competition, and then colonize the planet for humans, making the animals (feral or Anthro) their slaves. So whoever wins, its bad news for the native animals there. The best bet for them is to lock both bots in a never ending war between themselves, and bury them somewhere where they wont hurt the animals of the planet.

This place was the Arachnid Archives, by the way.

So this game will take place at the time when Alpha, Adirada, and the other “gods” got their start, and during their adventures, but from the point of view of the enemy. Which also happens to be the point of view of whoever picked up the headset, which might actually be Adirada. Im not sure yet.

And the main reason why I want it to be someone whos not familiar with the nanobots is bc I want their to be alien symbols that the player doesn’t understand right away and has to figure out. Bc I think learning a new symbol set might be a fun part of the game.

But also, having Adirada be the one with the headset might be the thing that Alpha sees, and makes him break his loyalty, or tests his loyalty. And it also might test Adirada’s truth, and might put a strain on their relationship. This might also be how Adirada first finds out about the terrible fate that awaits them if they successfully eradicate the nanobots. I think maybe the spider convinced Adirada to keep it a secret, for safety reasons. Then something happens, and both of them realize they should have told their teammates sooner.

One thing to note: the nanobots cant control the anthros bc they were programmed to be unable to control humans, and the anthros have some human DNA, thus they cant be controlled. But the anthros are able to disable and disarm the nanobots. Its just that its easier to create more nanobots and control more animals more quickly than it is to turn an animal into an Anthro, or give birth to a new one.

So that’s the backstory behind the game, if it goes in that direction. Might also introduce the characters a bit.
